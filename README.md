# Breast-Cancer-Task2
Apply and compare **linear** and **non-linear SVMs** for a binary classification problem using a real-world dataset.
## Objective

Apply and compare **linear** and **non-linear SVMs** for a binary classification problem using a real-world dataset.

---

## Tools & Libraries ##

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
-
## Steps Followed **
Load and prepare the Breast Cancer dataset.

Normalize the features using StandardScaler.

Train SVM models using linear and RBF kernels.

Visualize decision boundaries (on 2D projection).

Tune hyperparameters like C and gamma.

Evaluate models using accuracy and cross-validation.

## Results ##
Accuracy comparison between linear and RBF kernels

Cross-validation performance metrics
